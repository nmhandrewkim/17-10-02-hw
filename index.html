            <li>Preheat oven to 500 degrees</li>
            <li>Divide dough in half and mold into a hemisphere</li>
            <li>Flour a large sheet of parchment paper to prevent dough from sticking</li>
            <li>Place dough on parchment paper and sprinkle flour on the dough</li>
            <li>Using a rolling pin, roll dough from the center outwards until dough is rectangular and less than half an inch thick</li>
            <li>Using a spoon, spread pizza sauce onto the dough. Leave a one and a half inch to two inch border clear of any sauce or ingredients. <strong>Do not use too much sauce;
            excessive use of sauce will result in a soggy pastry!</strong></li>
            <li>Spread mozzarella on top of the sauce</li>
            <li>Place lines of pepperoni, salami, and prosciutto across the mozzarella. Make sure to cover the mozzarella.</li>
            <li>Spread slices of pepper jack on top of the protein</li>
            <li>Use a brush to brush the beaten egg on the dough, around the cheese</li>
            <li>Fold the edge of the dough that's furthest away from you on itself to half the length of the border</li>
            <li>Brush the folded edge with the beaten egg</li>
            <li>Gripping the side of the parchment paper that's furthest away from you, lift the paper to start folding the stromboli</li>
            <li>Roll the stromboli towards yourself. Make sure that no ingredients spill</li>
            <li>Before rolling the stromboli for the last time, fold in the horizontal edges and brush with the beaten egg</li>
            <li>Finish rolling the stromboli</li>
            <li>Place the parchment paper with the stromboli on a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Make sure the seam of the stromboli is facing down</li>
            <li>Brush the top and sides of the stromboli with the beaten egg</li>
            <li>Score the top of the stromboli with diagonal cuts no more than half an inch deep</li>
            <li>Sprinkle parsley and remainder of mozzarella on top of the stromboli</li>
            <li>Bake for 13-15 minutes or until crust is golden brown</li>

                &emsp;The stromboli is a pastry made by placing fillings on a piece of dough, folding the dough over, sealing, and baking it.
                Fillings typically include various cheeses - such as mozzarella - and Italian meats such as prosciutto, pepperoni, salami, or pancetta. 
                The dish was invented in the United States during the 1950s, and was named after the Italian film <em>Stromboli</em>.
